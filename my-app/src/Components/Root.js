            <p>
                I'm Devin Diaz, a third-year Computer Science student at Framingham State University with a 
                strong passion for technology and software development. I enjoy working on projects that challenge 
                me to grow as a developer, particularly in backend engineering. Outside of coding, I find peace in 
                playing soccer and staying active. Currently, I'm focused on honing my skills and preparing for a career 
                in software engineering, with a particular interest in AI and backend systems.

                Recently, I've been diving into the world of robotics, exploring the capabilities of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) 
                as I expand my knowledge in this exciting field. My goal is to combine my software development expertise with robotics 
                to create innovative solutions that can make a tangible impact. As I continue to learn and grow, I'm eager to see where 
                this journey into the robotics scene will take me. Feel free to reach out to me at diazdevin7@outlook.com for any inquiries 
                or collaborations.
