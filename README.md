# Personal Portfolio

This personal portfolio provides an overview of my interests, projects, and resume. It highlights the areas I'm passionate about and the work I've done so far.
I built this portfolio using React as a way to improve my skills in the framework and to create a clean, organized platform to showcase my experiences.
